Three small LaTeX utilities in C

'mand' suppress all the occurences of a LaTeX command from a file and discard the '{' and '}' of its arguments; default is command '\modif' but can be set with option '-c'
'ment' suppress all LaTeX comments from a file
'flat' flatten all LaTeX commands from a file

type 'make all' for compiling
